## Development

We recommand using the `.devcontainer` with VSCode.

Once in the container:

1. Install dependancies: `npm install`
2. Run project in development mode: `npm run dev`
3. Test Static Deployment: `npm build`
4. Static Deployment should be available under the `out` directory. You can then use either an extension like LiveServer to

## Continous Integration

### Tests

All commits to the `main` and `development` branches or `pull-requests` to the same branches are tested with ESLint.

### Deployment

All changes to the `main` branch update the project page deployment.
